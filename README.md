# A-Standard-Gas-Network
I designed a standard gas network to whom might be useful in scientific society.
This network includes 27 nodes and 33 pipes from 760 mm internal diameter to 600 mm. This network is a transmission network to transport a large flow rate.
For standardisation of the network modelled in multi scenarios involving gas quality by injecting alternative gases such as hydrogen and biomethane. This designed model has been tested more than 1000 times and slightly developed to respond to gas scientists and engineers who are looking for an example to model the gas transmission systems.
